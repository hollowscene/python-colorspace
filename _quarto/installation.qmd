title: Package Installation
---

This package is available via the
[Python Package index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/colorspace/) or via 
[GitHub](https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace).
A few requirements are needed to be able to use the package and all its features.

* Python `3.10+` (tested for {{PYTEST_VERSIONS}})
* [`numpy`](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>)
* [`matplotlib`](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/>)
* [`imageio`](https://pypi.org/project/imageio/>) (optional; only used for
    [`cvd_emulator`](/man/colorspace.cvd_emulator.cvd_emulator.qmd))
* [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (optional; used [`dataset`](/man/colorspace.datasets.dataset.qmd))

Please use the the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace/issues>)
to report bugs and issues as well as feature requests. There is no
guarantee that feature requests can be accommodated, especially as we try to
keep both, the R and Python version of the package, around the same level.

**Installing**

The latest release can be directly installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/colorspace/)
using:

```
pip install colorspace
```

... or installing the last version (GitHub head branch) using:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace
```

Alternatively, clone the git repository and install the package from there:

```
git clone https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace.git
cd python-colorspace && python setup.py install
```

**Using a virtual environment**

The repository contains a `Makefile` and requirements files to set up virtual
environments.  Note that this requires `make` and `virtualenv` to be
installed.

To set up a virtual environments the git repository must be cloned first;
afterwards you should be able to set up the virtual environment
and install the _colorspace_ package.

```
git clone https://github.com/retostauffer/python-colorspace.git
cd python-colorspace
make venv
make install
```

This will set up a virtual environment and also install the required
Python packages before installing the latest version of the _colorspace_
package from the repository.
