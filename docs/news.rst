Version 0.1.0 (September 17, 2018)
----------------------------------

**Early beta release**.

A wide range of methods are already implemented and roughly
tested. I've decided to launch it as an early beta release
to get some feedback from those who use python more frequently
than I do! Feel free to report bugs, ideas, or even contribute.

I'll try to update update the documentation as soon as possible
and to improve the package itself, if I can find a free time slot.

Version 0.0.1 (beginning of September 2018)
-------------------------------------------

Development version.

First implementation of the ``colorspace`` package in python.
This is still an early alpha version, I am currently working
on better documentation, testing, and getting the necessary
classes and objects into the package to provide a useful
toolbox for python enthusiasts.
