# Summary

The Python _colorspace_ package provides a toolbox for selecting efficient
color palettes, manipulate and assess these colors, and employ them using
existing plotting and graphing libraries such as e.g., _matplotlib_, _seaborn_,
or _plotly_.

One key feature is that the package
provides a variety of color palettes based on the HCL (hue-chroma-luminance)
color space. The three dimension of the HCL color space have been shown
to three perceptual dimensions of the human visual system very well, thus
allowing for intuitive construction of color palettes using trajectories
in this three-dimensional space. Using general strategies, three types of
HCL-based palettes are implemented: Qualitative palettes for categorical
data, sequential palettes for mapping ordered/numeric information, and
diverging palettes for coding ordered/numeric data with a central neutral
value. Besides a variety of predefined HCL-palettes, users can easily
customize these palettes to their needs.

The package provides easy access to transform colors between
different color spaces, allowing to easily implement additional trajectory-based
palettes. Furthermore, a series of functions and methods exist to manipulate and
access sets of colors and/or color palettes, and emulate color vision deficiencies
to check for possible issues with a selected color palette or set of colors.

The lightweight _colorspace_ package supports all Python users in picking (and
testing) custom and effective color maps to get the best out of any visualization.




# Statement of need

Visualization and graphics are often used to communicate scientific results.
However, inefficient color maps can easily break things and have to be
chosen carefully [@Tufte:1990; @Brewer:1999; @Ware:2004; @Wilkinson:2005; @Wilke:2019; @Baum:2019; @Crameri:2020].
Over the past years awareness has risen and many plotting libraries have
changed their default color palette for the better. As one well-known example,
`matplotlib 2.0` was released with an update on mostly all default colors
[@matplotlib20:colors]. Most noticeably 'viridis' replaces the classical 'jet'
color map, a color map very similar to the infamous RGB rainbow color palette,
facing the same problems.

Historically, color palettes were often based on the red-green-blue (RGB)
color space as this is computer and TV screens work. However, RGB based
palettes often have serious issues creating (strongly) imbalanced colors which
can artificially distort information, making figures and graphs hard to digest
by humands, and/or can hardly be read by people with visual constraints.

**Reto: Hier koennte man e.v. noch Tufte oder dieses Psycopapier einbauen (history);
denke aber, dass es dann zu viel wird.**

Thus, people have been working on improved color maps in different areas with
different strategies. More recently and widely known these days
are the 'Brewer palettes' [@harrower:2003], a series of palettes for differen
type of data which all have been manually selected in an experiment, relying on
human perception.

An alternative approach is to use a color space representing the way the human
visual system processes the information. Color models that attempt to capture
these perceptual axes are also called perceptually-based color spaces. Whilst a
series of color models that are (or try to) capture these axis exist. One color
space which has shown to captures these dimensions very well is the
Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) model, the polar representation of the CIELUV color
space. The three dimensions define the following:

* **Hue:** Type of color
* **Chroma:** Colorfullnes
* **Luminance:** Brightness

This allows to define a variety of efficient and well-defined color palettes by
directly controlling the three perceptual dimensions and is the key color model
used by the Python _colorspace_ package, tough other color models are supported
as well. For more details and further references about human visual system and
color perception see e.g., @Kaiser:1996, @Knoblauch:2002, @Ihaka:2003,
@R:dichromat and/or @Zeileis:2007.



# Key functionality

## Color spaces

At the core of the colorspace package are various utilities for computing with
color spaces [@Wiki:Colorspace], as the name conveys. Thus, the package helps to
map various three-dimensional representations of color to each other @Ihaka:2003.
A particularly important mapping is the one from the perceptually-based
and device-independent color model HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance; polar representation
of the CIELUV color space) to standard
Red-Green-Blue (sRGB) which is the basis for color specifications in many
systems based on the corresponding hex codes [@Wiki:Webcolors], e.g., in HTML
but also in Python. All color models supported by _colorspace_ and their interconnections
are illustrated in Figure \autoref{fig-colorspaces}

![Illustration of the different color spaces implemented in package and the connection between them. Color models that are (or try to be) perceptually-based are displayed with circles and models that are not are displayed with rectangles.\label{fig-colorspaces}](paper_assets/fig_colorspaces.png)

## Color transformation

Python _colorspace_ allows to define colors colors in one color model
and transform them into another supported colormodel. In the following example,
three colors are defined in the sRGB color model (pure red, green, and blue)
and then transformed into the HCL color space.

```{python}
from colorspace.colorlib import sRGB
cols = sRGB(R = [1, 0, 0], G = [0, 1, 0], B = [0, 0, 1])
print(cols)
```
```{python}
cols.to("HCL")
print(cols)
```
```{python}
cols.colors() # Extract hex colors (list of str)
```

`sRGB` is a class for handling one or multiple colors in the sRGB color model.
Using the `.to()` method transforms these colors from sRGB via RGB to CIEXYZ,
CIELUV, to polarLUV (=HCL) as shown in Figure \autoref{fig-colorspaces}.
The method `.colors()` then goes trough the same path in reverse, finally
converting the colors to their hex (web color) representation which are
`#FF0000` (pure red), `#00FF00` (pure green), and `#0000FF` (pure blue).

All color models inherit from the superclass `colorobject`, which allows
to define colors in any of the defined color spaces (Fig. \autoref{fig-colorspaces})
and convert from one to another (if supported).





## Chosing color palettes

A key feature of _colorspace_ is to chose, modify, and create effective
color maps in the HCL color space. This makes use of the color transformation shown
above, as the three types of HCL-palettes shown below (Fig. \autofig{fig-palette-types})
are not based on a fixed set of colors, but define functions representing the
trajectories trough the three dimensions of the HCL color model. When drawing a
certain number of colors from the palette, the function for all three dimensions
(hue-chroma-luminance) are evaluated, turned into an object of class `HCL` (`polarLUV`)
and returned as hex colors. The three main functions classes are:

* `qualitative_hcl`: Create qualitative HCL-based palettes, designed for coding
    categorical information, i.e., where no
    particular ordering of categories is available and every color should
    receive the same perceptual weight.
* `sequential_hcl`: Create sequential HCL-based palettes, designed for coding
    ordered/numeric information, i.e., going from
    high to low (or vice versa).
* `diverging_hcl`: Create diverging HCL-based palettes, designed for coding
    ordered/numeric information around a central
    neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes.

Figure \autoref{fig-palette-types} shows the default palette for all three types.

```{python}
#| fig-cap: Example of a qualitative, single-hue sequential, and diverging color palette, using the `swatchplot` function for visualization.
#| label: fig-palette-types
from colorspace import palette, swatchplot
from colorspace import qualitative_hcl, sequential_hcl, diverging_hcl

qual = palette(qualitative_hcl().colors(7), name = "Qualitative")
sequ = palette(sequential_hcl().colors(15), name = "Sequential")
dive = palette(diverging_hcl().colors(15),  name = "Diverging")

swatchplot([qual, sequ, dive], figsize = (6, 1.5));
```

Besides the default palettes shown above, _colorspace_ comes with a variety of
predefined palettes which an be used and customized if needed. Figure \autoref{fig-namedpalettes} shows an example for each palette type, using the predefined palettes
`qualitative_hcl("Cold")`, `sequential_hcl("ag_Sunset")`, and `diverging_hcl("Green-Orange")`
with 15 colors each.

```{python}
#| label: fig-namedpalette
#| fig-cap: Different predefined HCL-based color palettes by name.
from colorspace import swatchplot
from colorspace import qualitative_hcl, sequential_hcl, diverging_hcl

cold        = qualitative_hcl("Cold")
agsunset    = sequential_hcl("ag_Sunset")
greenorange = diverging_hcl("Green-Orange")

swatchplot([cold, agsunset, greenorange], n = 15,
           show_names = False, figsize = (6, 1.5));
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-hcl-palettes
#| fig-cap: Overview of all predefined HCL color palettes which can be fully customized and used as a starting point for getting a tailored palette, if needed.
from colorspace import hcl_palettes
hcl_palettes(plot = True, figsize = (20, 15))
```




## Assess and manipulate colors

Taking `diverging_hcl("Green-Orange")` as example, looking at the spectrum
reveals how the palette is constructed in the HCL space. Whilst hue is taking a
constant value on either side of the diverging palette, both luminance and
chroma have a symmetrical linear change around the neutral center color, with lowest
chroma (thus grayish) and highest luminance (towards white) in the center.

```{python}
#| fig-cap: Spectrum of the default `diverging_hcl("Green-Orange")` palette in both the HCL color space (bottom) as well as the sRGB color space (top).
#| label: fig-spectrum
from colorspace import diverging_hcl
diverging_hcl("Green-Orange").specplot(rgb = True)
```

The RGB spectrum (Fig. \autoref{fig-spectrum}, top) shows that, although possible,
this palette can't be defined easily or intuitively.

Furthermore, _colorspace_ allows to assess the efficiency of colors/color maps
with respect to people with visual constraints by (i) simulating the most common
types of color blindness (deuteranomaly, protanomaly, and tritanomaly) and full
color blindness, using the infamous RGB rainbow palette and the three default
sequential, diverging, and qualitative palettes of _colorspace_.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cvd
#| fig-caption: Simulating color vision defficiency (`severity = 1.0`; default) for the infamous RGB rainbow palette (left) and default palettes for qualitative, sequential, and diverging HCL-based color palettes.
from colorspace import rainbow, diverging_hcl, palette
from colorspace import deutan, protan, tritan, desaturate
rain = rainbow().colors(11)
sequ = sequential_hcl().colors(11)
dive = diverging_hcl().colors(11)
qual = qualitative_hcl().colors(11)

# Setting up palettes
rain_pals = [palette(rain, "original"), palette(deutan(rain), "deutan"),
             palette(protan(rain), "protan"), palette(tritan(rain), "tritan"),
             palette(desaturate(rain), "desaturate")]
qual_pals = [palette(qual, "original"), palette(deutan(qual), "deutan"),
             palette(protan(qual), "protan"), palette(tritan(qual), "tritan"),
             palette(desaturate(qual), "desaturate")]
sequ_pals = [palette(sequ, "original"), palette(deutan(sequ), "deutan"),
             palette(protan(sequ), "protan"), palette(tritan(sequ), "tritan"),
             palette(desaturate(sequ), "desaturate")]
dive_pals = [palette(dive, "original"), palette(deutan(dive), "deutan"),
             palette(protan(dive), "protan"), palette(tritan(dive), "tritan"),
             palette(desaturate(dive), "desaturate")]

swatchplot({"Rainbow": rain_pals, "Qualitative HCL": qual_pals,
            "Sequential HCL": sequ_pals, "Diverging HCL": dive_pals},
            nrow = 6 * 2, figsize = (8, 3.5));
```

Figure \autoref{fig-cvd} shows how badly inefficient color maps can break down. Tough
this is an extreme example, the RGB rainbow has been used for decades without caution,
and it (or palettes with similar issues) are still used today. In contrast, the
well-defined HCL-based color maps (mostly) keep their integrity but are, in all situations,
better than the rainbow alternative. The qualitative and diverging HCL palettes break
down in the desaturated version (gray-scale), tough this is by design as the luminance
(brightness) is almost constant for the qualitative palette, and identical on both
ends (by construction) in case of diverging palettes.

In addition to the functions demonstrated above, _colorspace_ provides additional
functionality for color manipulation (see [Documentation](https://retostauffer.github.io/python-colorspace/)).



## Use with existing plotting libraries

The HCL-based color palettes can be integrated into commonly used
Python packages for plotting such as 
[`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/),
[`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/), and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/).
For the latter all palettes come with a `cmap()` method to generate objects of 
class `LinearSegmentedColormap` as used by by matplotlib, making it straight forward
to be used with most matplotlib plotting functions.

Below, examples for `maptlotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` can be seen. More examples
can be found in the dedicated articles in our [Documentation](https://retostauffer.github.io/python-colorspace/).

#### Matplotlib

The following figure shows a two-dimensional histogram
(joint density) of the daily minimum and maximum temperature observed
at a weather station in the Harz region in Germany using the
"HarzTraffic" data set. The custom HCL-based palette is provided
as 'cmap' (a `LinearSegmentedColormap`) using the `.cmap()` method.

Whilst the left supblot uses the sequential
HCL-based color palette "ag_Sunset" (reversed), the right plot shows
the same data using the "Blues 2" palette.

```{python matplotlib_minimal}
#| warning: true
#| error: true
#| label: fig-matplotlib

from colorspace import sequential_hcl, dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Loading data
df = dataset("HarzTraffic")

# Creating new figure
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize = (10, 5))

ax1.hist2d(df.tempmin, df.tempmax, bins = 20,
           cmap = sequential_hcl("ag_Sunset", rev = True).cmap())
ax2.hist2d(df.tempmin, df.tempmax, bins = 20,
           cmap = sequential_hcl("Blues 2").cmap())

# Setting title and labels
ax1.set_title("Joint density daily min/max temperature")
ax1.set_xlabel("minimum temperature [deg C]")
ax1.set_ylabel("maximum temperature [deg C]")
ax2.set_title("Joint density daily min/max temperature")
ax2.set_xlabel("minimum temperature [deg C]")
plt.show()
```


#### Seaborn

To demonstrate the use of HCL-based colormaps with seaborn, 
the barplot below shows the average number of bikes per day of week (with error bars)
during summer seasons (June, July, August) 2021 to 2023.

```{python seaborn_minimal}
#| fig-cap: Eample of integrating a series of qualitative colors with `seaborn`.
#| label: fig-seaborn
#| warning: true
#| error: true
#| layout-ncol: 1

from colorspace import qualitative_hcl, dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Loading data set
df = dataset("HarzTraffic")
df = df.loc[(df.season == "summer"), :]

sns.barplot(x = "dayofweek", y = "bikes", hue = "dow", data = df,
            order = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
            legend = False,
            palette = qualitative_hcl("Harmonic").colors(7))
plt.title("Average number of bikes per day of week\nsummer season 2021-2023")
plt.show()
```

#### Plotly

Finally, an example using the plotly graphics library is shown.
The interactive plot below shows the daily mean temperature plotted
against the day of year (Julian day) for the three consecutive years
2021, 2022, and 2023 using colors from the (slightly adjusted) diverging HCL-based
color palette "Blue-Red".

```{python plotly_minimal}
from colorspace import diverging_hcl, dataset
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df = dataset("HarzTraffic")
df["year"] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df.date).year

# Picking three colors from (adjusted) diverging color map
cols = diverging_hcl("Blue-Red", l2 = 60).colors(3)

# Plotting
fig = px.line(df, x = "yday", y = "temp", color = "year",
        title = "Daily mean temperature<br>Sonnenberg, Harz, Germany",
        color_discrete_sequence = cols,
        template = "plotly_white",
        labels = {"yday": "day of year", "temp": "temperature [deg C]"})
fig.write_image("paper_assets/fig_plotly.pdf")
fig.write_image("paper_assets/fig_plotly.svg")
```
